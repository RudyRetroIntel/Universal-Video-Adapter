Universal Composite and RGB2HDMI Output Board

Get external composite and RGB2HDMI video for retro\vintage computers.

I created these boards so that I could get external composite video in my Kaypro II computer. Then the project expanded to include RGB2HDMI connection. Finally, it was changed so that the board could work on many retro\vintage computers.
The first board produces composite output and RGB2HDMI connections. Both can be used at the same time. For the HDMI video to work you will need to purchase the RGBtoHDMI adapter. It is available in several places, so just search for the name on the internet.
The second board used to get RGB2HDMI output. Again, you will need the adapter board to use it.
You only need one of the two boards so make only what you need. 
Hopefully, you find this board is good to have and let me know in which computer you are using it in
